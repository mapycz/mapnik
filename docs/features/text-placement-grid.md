# Text placement `grid`

Allows placing repeated text on area of a polygon. All possible placements creates grid of points. Only placements within given polygon are rendered. These are basic use cases:

* Labeling areas in given density.
* Adding areas into collision detector by rendering labels with zero opacity.

Grid density can be controlled by `grid-cell-width` and `grid-cell-height` properties of text symbolizer.
