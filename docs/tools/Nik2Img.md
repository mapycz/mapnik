# Mapnik Maps on the Command-Line

*Nik2img* is a _third-party_ program that allows you to easily generate mapnik graphics from Mapnik xml or Cascadenik mml.

 * No python coding is required, only a working Mapnik installation and an XML mapfile.
 * *Nik2img* has a variety of options that make it a useful mapfile debugger.
 * Using *Nik2img* is an easy way to test and develop your xml mapfiles before launching on a server.
 * *Nik2img* should automatically open the rendered map once completed.
 * Like Mapnik, it should run on both Mac, Linux, and Windows

To Install:

 * Download from http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/

```sh
    $ sudo easy_install -U nik2img
